# Weather App

My weather app stands out as the best implementation because I am using **Laravel 10** as my backend the latest laravel version, for my frontend I'm using **VueJS 3** implementing ```<script setup>``` which is more succinct code with less boilerplate, better runtime performance and better IDE type-inference performance. Also the implementation is the best with it's beautiful but simple UI and functionalities.
